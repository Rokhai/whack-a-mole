Game Mechanics
==============================

Easy Mode(points gain = +1; points deducted= -1):
- 1 ghost moving in random direction
- 1 mole hit it to get 1 point

Medium Mode(points gain = +2; points deducted= -1):
- Easy mode with
- 1 Dud mole (hit it to -1 point)
- another 1 ghost moving in random direction

Hard(still unplayable)(points gain = +5; points deducted= -2):
- Medium mode but with
- 1 red ghost(following the mole around) - increased in speed every click
- Another 1 ghost moving in random direction



Relocate time:
Easy mode = 1000
Medium mode = 900
Hard mode = 800 - more than this, its very hard to react to


Ghost mechanics:
- if touched minus the deduction
- if collided with good mole minus the deduction

Dud/evil mole mechanics
- if touched minus the deduction

Good mole mechanics
- if touch add the points earned
